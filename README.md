> How I started This for MAC?

Step 1: Choose any Location to clone Flutter SDK, for me it was: '~/dev/tooling/flutter'

Step 2: Clone the flutter repo git clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git -b stable (This may change so [Visit here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install))

Step 3: Update Path: Open Vim ~/.zshrc and write this line and save. export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_OF_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/bin"
Then reload Path using: source ~/.zshrc

Step 4: Run flutter doctor and install missing like Xcode, Andriod SDK, Git etc.
